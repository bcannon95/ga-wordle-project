General Assembly Wordle Project


# FilmLE
A wordle spin off which prompts the user to guess a movie from the top 250 list on IMDB

## Project Description
The application requires the user to input a movie name based on the amount of divs rendered on the page. This will change pending on the length of the movie title. As it can be difficult to think of movies with long titles the application allows the user to enter any random selection of letters. The amount of guesses per game is randomized from 6-10.

This program was built using a javascript framework with html elements that are styled by css. These technologies allowed me to clearly structure the html and then add the javascript and css accordingly. With clear error handling abilities i could see where i was getting stuck through different parts of the project and effectively work on a fix to move forward.

I'd like to add a modal or alert in the future that shows the user they have won the game. I found this difficult to implement as the alert would trigger before the tiles have a chance to change to green meaning the player would know instantly if they'd won and therefore no suspense.
